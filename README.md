# Task 3 – Dashboard Development  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is part of my internship at **CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS**.  
In **Task 3**, I developed an **interactive dashboard** using **Power BI** to analyze chocolate product shipment data.  

The dashboard provides insights into shipments, sales amount, profit, and product/team performance across different regions.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Create an interactive dashboard using Power BI.  
- Visualize shipment and sales data across teams, geographies, and products.  
- Provide actionable insights for decision-making.

## 📊 Dashboard Features  
The Power BI dashboard includes the following visualizations:  
- **Shipments count by Team** (Donut Chart)  
- **Sum of Amount by Team** (Pie Chart)  
- **Total Profit by Geography** (Bar Chart)  
- **Shipments count by Year and Month** (Line Chart)  
- **Sum of Amount by Product** (Bar Chart)  
- **Profit % by Product** (Table with conditional formatting)

## 🗂 Dataset  
The dataset contains chocolate shipment details with the following attributes:  
- **Product** – Name of the chocolate product  
- **Team** – Sales team (Delish, Juicies, Tempo, Yummies)  
- **Geo** – Geography (India, USA, UK, etc.)

## 📈 Key Insights  
- The **Delish team** contributes the highest shipment count and sales.  
- **India** leads in overall profits, followed by New Zealand and Australia.  
- **Caramel Stuffed Bars** and **Organic Choco Syrup** are among the top revenue-generating products.  
- Certain products like **85% Dark Bars** and **Baker’s Choco Chips** recorded negative profit margins.  
- Seasonal trends indicate **shipment peaks in the last quarter** of each year.
